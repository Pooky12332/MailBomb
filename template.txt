// The program reads the first 7 lines of the text file given
// These 7 lines correspond to the first 7 options
// The last option to "write all settings to a file" is turned off as this is all in a file
// Enter them like you normally would and then save the file in the same dir
// Then when asked what file you would like to use, enter the name of the file
// Inclue the type of file it is, as long as the script can read the first 7 lines then it doesnt matter
// e.g.: myfriend.txt
